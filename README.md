Project 4 - Dynamic Web Applications

My project 4 is a diary logger, very similar to OhLife. The user can create an account and view and edit their diary posts from the website. The user also sets up a time to recieve a daily email. The email will serve the purpose of getting the user's diary entry. By replying to the email with the user's diary entry, it is added to the online diary. There is also no social function to the website and the diary entries are kept private from other users.

Features:
* Sign up new user
* Login user
* Logout user
* Send a daily email to retrieve a diary entry from the user
* Edit the time the user will recieve the email
* Add a post through the website for any day
* Edit any post through the website
* Delete any post through the website

Maybes:
* Save entire diary to a text file
* Delete an account / all the user's data

Aspects of the application managed by Javascript:
* Client-side form validation
